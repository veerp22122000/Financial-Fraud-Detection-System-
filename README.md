What are the key factors that predict fraudulent customer?

Transaction Patterns: Unusual transaction amounts, frequency, or merchant categories.
Geolocation & Device: Unusual locations, new devices, or geographical inconsistencies.
Account Changes: Sudden changes in personal info (address, email, etc.).
Payment Methods: Use of multiple or prepaid cards, switching payment methods.
Past Fraud: Previous fraud history or frequent chargebacks.
Demographics: Age, income, and employment factors.



Do these factors make sense? If yes, How? If not, How not? <br\>

Transaction patterns (e.g., unusual amounts or frequency) and geolocation/device changes signal abnormal behavior.
Sudden account changes and unusual login patterns often point to account takeovers.
Multiple or prepaid payment methods are typical of fraud attempts.
Past fraud history predicts future risk.
Demographics and suspicious communication provide additional context but must be used carefully to avoid bias.



What kind of prevention should be adopted while company update its infrastructure? 

Enhanced Authentication: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometric login, and device fingerprinting.
Real-time Fraud Detection: Implement AI-based monitoring, anomaly detection, and geolocation tracking.
Data Security: Ensure end-to-end encryption, tokenization, and secure payment gateways.
Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits, testing.
Behavioral Monitoring: Track user transactions for suspicious activity.
Access Control: Limit access with role-based controls and enforce strong password policies.
External Collaboration: Utilize shared fraud databases and work with financial institutions.
Customer Education: Raise awareness about phishing and fraud risks.
Should have fraud detection systems and a dedicated response team.



Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they work?

Track the number of fraud attempts and successful fraud cases over time. A decreasing trend indicates effectiveness.
Measure how often legitimate activities are incorrectly flagged as fraud. Lower false positives show improved precision.
Analyze customer feedback and complaints related to security measures, ensuring that protections don't negatively impact user experience.
Evaluate how quickly fraud detection systems identify and prevent fraud. Faster detection means better system performance.
